    <h2>Clock application</h2>
</div>

Simple clock application built in `Python` using `tkinter` for the Graphic User Interface. There's a release version of the app and you can download it for free, also comes with the source code in a `.zip` format. 

The clock app translates the text depending on where you're, so you don't gotta worry about that part itself. 

Small project made within 1 hour as I don't have previous `Python` knowledge and research was needed for certain libraries.

### Usage

If you're gonna download the source code (as it is open-sourced and everyone can see it/modify it or even download it) then you should know you gotta install a few things here and there. Even though it's just a simple commands. 

First things first, you should know that `googletrans` isn't a built-in library from `Python` so that's the first one we will be installing, go to your command line/terminal and write the next command: 
```
pip install googletrans
```

After that, you're ready to go and use the code however you want!
